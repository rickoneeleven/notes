You're absolutely right. My apologies for the length. I've been trying to cover all angles and explain the "why," but in doing so, I've made it more complex than it needs to be. Brevity is key.

Let's strip it down to the core issue and the simplest, most "Vite-native" solution that avoids extra scripts if possible.

**The Core Problem:**
Vite, by default with `emptyOutDir: true`, wipes the output directory (`dist/`) and only puts frontend assets there. Your PHP files, `.htaccess`, etc., are not automatically included if they aren't treated as static assets by Vite.

**Simplest Vite-Friendly Approach (Revisiting Vite's `publicDir`):**

This minimizes extra scripts and uses Vite's built-in mechanisms as much as possible.

1.  **Virtualmin Document Root:**
    *   Set to `project_root/dist/` (as you found works when `dist/` is fully populated).

2.  **Project Structure Change (Minor):**
    *   Create a new directory at your project root: `project_root/static_server_files/`
    *   **Move** these files/folders into it:
        *   `project_root/public/api/`  --> `project_root/static_server_files/api/`
        *   `project_root/public/note.php` --> `project_root/static_server_files/note.php`
        *   `project_root/public/.htaccess` --> `project_root/static_server_files/.htaccess`
        *   `project_root/config.json` --> `project_root/static_server_files/config.json`
        *   `project_root/notes/` --> `project_root/static_server_files/notes/`
        *   `project_root/setup-password.php` --> `project_root/static_server_files/setup-password.php`

3.  **`vite.config.js` Changes:**
    ```javascript
    // vite.config.js
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import { resolve } from 'path';

    export default defineConfig({
      root: 'public', // Frontend source code (JS, CSS, dev index.html) is still here
      publicDir: '../static_server_files', // Vite will copy everything from here to 'dist/'
      build: {
        outDir: '../dist',    // Output to project_root/dist/
        emptyOutDir: true,    // Wipes dist/ before build (good)
        rollupOptions: {
          input: {
            main: resolve(__dirname, 'public/index.html') // Uses public/index.html as template
          }
        }
      },
      // ... server proxy config ...
    });
    ```

4.  **PHP Path Adjustments (Crucial):**
    Since `api/`, `note.php`, `config.json`, `notes/` will now all be directly inside `dist/` after the build (e.g., `dist/api/`, `dist/config.json`), your PHP scripts need to reference them accordingly.
    *   In `dist/api/index.php` (which comes from `static_server_files/api/index.php`):
        *   `define('CONFIG_PATH', '../config.json');` (to access `dist/config.json`)
        *   `define('NOTES_DIR', '../notes/');` (to access `dist/notes/`)
    *   And any other similar paths.

**How This Works (Simple Version):**

*   **`npm run dev`:**
    *   Vite uses `project_root/public/index.html` (pointing to `/js/app.js`, `/css/style.css`).
    *   Vite proxies API calls to your live server (or a local PHP dev server if you set one up that serves from `project_root/static_server_files/`).

*   **`npm run build`:**
    1.  Vite clears `project_root/dist/`.
    2.  Vite builds your frontend from `project_root/public/` into `project_root/dist/` (creating `dist/index.html` and `dist/assets/`).
    3.  Vite **copies everything** from `project_root/static_server_files/` directly into `project_root/dist/`.
        *   So, `dist/` will now contain `api/`, `note.php`, `.htaccess`, `config.json`, `notes/`, etc., alongside the frontend assets.

*   **Result:**
    *   `project_root/dist/` is fully self-contained and ready.
    *   **No post-build script needed.**
    *   You only manage the PHP files in `static_server_files/` and frontend in `public/`.

**Why this is simpler:**
*   Leverages Vite's `publicDir` feature.
*   No extra `fs-extra` dependency or custom Node.js script in `package.json`.
*   The "management" is just organizing your files into `public/` (for frontend source) and `static_server_files/` (for things Vite should just copy to the output).

This aligns with Vite's design: `root` for processed frontend source, `publicDir` for static assets to be copied as-is. The main "work" is the one-time move of your PHP-related files into `static_server_files/` and adjusting their internal paths if needed.

This should feel much less like a workaround and more like configuring Vite to understand your project structure.
